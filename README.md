# Mileage-Mania

## Description

Mileage Mania is an annual mileage fund-raiser created by MotoTourer Jeff that began as a casual competition on Facebook in 2014. In 2015, it was made into a charity event and started raising money for veterans-based charities. Since 2016 it has focused on benefiting Freedom Service Dogs of America. As the fundraiser grew, it quickly became cumbersome to manage. This site is intended to streamline the submission and review process to allow for Jeff to spend less time managing the submission and more time out on the open road riding his own motorcycle.
